        We're sorry, but IOU is not available for iOS yet, please keep on
        checking this page, we will make the link available as soon as Apple
        aproves the app.
      <p>
        However, if you would like to have a preview of the app, you may do so
        using the web version:

      <p><a href="https://ioutest.firebaseapp.com">IOU App (Web version)</a></p>
      <p>
        Please note that our web version is still in Beta and may 'misbehave' if
        if you refresh the page. Should that happen, just go back to the 'Home'
        page and do a refresh from there.
