        We're sorry, but IOU is not available for iOS yet, however, if you would
        like to have a preview of the app, you may do so using the Ionic View
        (instructions below)
      </p>
      <p>Or use the web version:</p>
      <p><a href="https://ioutest.firebaseapp.com">IOU App (Web version)</a></p>
      <p>
        Please note that our web version is still in Beta and may 'misbehave' if
        if you refresh the page. Should that happen, just go back to the 'Home'
        page and do a refresh from there.
      </p>
      <h2>Ionic View</h2>
      <p>
        Ionic view makes it really easy to view an app without going through the
        App Store.
      </p>
      <p>
        To view IOU, you must first download and install Ionic View in your
        iPhone or iPad from the App Store:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a target="_blank" 
           href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ionic-view/id849930087?ls=1&mt=8">
          Ionic View
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Once installed, open the app, if you are a new user, you will have to
        sign up, otherwise, just log in with your credentials.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must then click the 'Preview App' button and enter the following App
        ID:
      </p>
