## Appendix C - The included USB

The included USB stick contains the source code for both the documentation and the application itself named implementation.

In order to create local builds and even make amendments, each section imposes a set of dependencies.

Appendix A explains in details how to compile and run the documentation files locally.

For the main IOU app, the following are the dependencies required for development:

- Git
  - Git-flow
- Ruby and Ruby Gems
  - SASS
  - Compass
- Node.js and NPM
  - Grunt
  - Bower
  - Ionic
  - ios-sim (mac only)
- A UNIX based shell
- SDKs
  - Android SDK
  - iOS SDK (mac only, comes with XCode)

Below is a quick guide on how to build the IOU implementation:

1 - Either copy the content of the implementation directory or clone the repository directly from GitHub then 'cd' into it:

    $ git clone https://github.com/jbonigomes/iou && cd $_

2 - Install the npm dependencies:

    $ npm install

3 - Install the bower dependencies:

    $ bower install

4 - To view the app run:

    $ grunt serve

5 - To build a new distribution run:

    $ grunt build

6 - To serve a built app run:

    $ grunt serve:dist

7 - To add a new platform run either/or:

    $ grunt platform:add:ios
    $ grunt platform:add:android

8 - To emulate a platform run:

    $ grunt emulate:ios

9 - To build a new release:

    $ grunt build:ios --release

Testing is still being implemented, however, the following command is already available for running unit tests:

    $ grunt test

Should you wish to try the protractor tests, first install Protractor globally:

    $ npm install -g protractor

Update the webdriver:

    $ webdriver-manager update

Spin up the server:

    $ webdriver-manager start

You can now run end-to-end tests like so:

    $ protractor test/e2e/conf.js
