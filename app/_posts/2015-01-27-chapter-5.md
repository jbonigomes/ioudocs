# Chapter 5

## Analisys Evaluation

After completing the IOU application, one major concern was how smooth the animations and transitions would perform in a real device. Up to that point, the application was only tested using emulators.

Surprisingly, as opposed to the bad reputation of hybrid apps performance (SitePoint), IOU responds quite well on Android devices.

Unfortunately, by the time of this writing, Apple is still reviewing IOU and, I am, therefore unable to comment on its' performance yet.

## Testing

IOU has been tested with several users, each of which presented their own problems, most of which were not bugs but simply different points of view on how the workflow should be approached.

The main goal of getting users to test the application early, was to not only collect early feedback, but also to ensure that the application validates and handles user input correctly, as well as ensuring that the calculation algorithms work correctly.

The scenarios tested were:

- Login
  - Can log in with valid Facebook credentials
  - Cannot log in with invalid Facebook credentials
  - Must accept the terms and conditions before login
  - User can read the terms and conditions
  - User can read the privacy policy
  - User can visit IOUs' home page

- Home
  - Only the lists that the currently logged user belongs to should be visible
  - User can create a new list
  - User can delete a list
  - User can edit a list
    - Name and image
  - An overall calculation of all lists in relation to the currently logged in user should be presented
  - Clicking on a list should navigate to the products view of that list

- Products
  - A total of the current list in relation to the currently logged in user should be presented in the top of this page
  - User can create a new product
    - A new product should appear as a 'To buy' product
  - User can buy a 'To buy' product
  - User can edit products that have been bought
    - Owner
    - Price
    - Name
  - A product that has been edited, must display an '@amended' tag

- Members
  - A total of the current list in relation to the currently logged in user should be presented in the top of this page
  - A list of all members that belong to the current list should be displayed here
    - Each member should display a calculated field of how much he/she owes or is owed in relation to the current logged in user
  - A new member can be added to this list

- All
  - Pages that require a login should present common links:
    - Home
    - Terms and conditions
    - Privacy policy
    - Logout
  - Validations
    - Any price entered must be a numeric value that is bigger than 0
    - All string fields are required and must therefore be completed

Each scenario was tested using different inputs to ensure that the appropriate validations triggered correctly.

## The future

Unfortunately, due to the tight deadline for this project, automated testing could not be implemented, however, the set up for this to happen is already in place and tests will be written in future iterations.

The most exciting testing framework present is Protractor (Angular.github.io), and End-to-end testing framework developed specifically for Angular.js.

Protractor uses a Selenium (Seleniumhq.org) driver to simulate users actions and ensure the expected outcome is met.

In addition, Mocha (Mochajs.org) and Chai (Chaijs.com) are already set up to perform the unit tests, those tests run using Angulars' Karma Runner (Karma-runner.github.io) and using Istanbul (Gotwarlost.github.io), produce static websites with the results and the code coverage stats.
